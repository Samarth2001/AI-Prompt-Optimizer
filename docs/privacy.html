    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Prompt Enhancer ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to
      protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your
      information when you use our Chrome extension.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All data
      processed by the extension remains on your local machine or is sent
      directly to the AI service provider you have configured.
    </p>

    <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>API Keys:</strong> If you choose to use your own API key (Bring
      Your Own Key), it is stored locally on your device using the
      `chrome.storage.local` API and transmitted only to the AI provider via our
      proxy endpoint over HTTPS for the sole purpose of fulfilling your request.
      The key is never logged or stored by our servers and is not exposed to web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prompts and Context:</strong> Your prompts and any conversational
      context are sent to the AI service provider you have selected for the
      purpose of enhancement. We do not log, store, or monitor this information.
    </p>

    <h2>Anonymous Usage Data</h2>
    <p>
      To provide the free tier, a pseudonymous session token (JWT) is stored in
      browser session storage and sent to our proxy server to enforce rate limits.
      It is not associated with personal information, and we do not log prompt content.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The extension communicates with third-party AI service providers (e.g.,
      OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to provide its functionality. We
      are not responsible for the privacy practices of these services. We
      encourage you to review their privacy policies before using them.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take security seriously. The extension is built with a
      "security-by-design" approach, including a strict Content Security Policy
      (CSP) and HTTPS enforcement for all network requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new policy in the extension and updating the
      "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
