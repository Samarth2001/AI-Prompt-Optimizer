# Prompt Enhancer

A Chrome extension that adds "✨ Enhance" buttons to text fields on web pages, allowing you to enhance prompts using the OpenRouter API.

## How It Works

The extension automatically detects text areas and input fields on web pages and adds a floating "✨ Enhance" button to each one. Click the button to enhance whatever text you've typed.

## Setup

1. **Get an API Key**: Sign up at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) for a free API key
2. **Install Extension**: Load the extension in Chrome developer mode
3. **Set API Key**: Click the extension icon and save your API key

## Usage

1. **Go to any website** with text inputs (Gmail, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. **Type your prompt** in any text field
3. **Click the "✨ Enhance" button** that appears in the text field
4. **Your prompt gets enhanced** and replaced automatically

## Examples

- Enhanced: "Write a professional email with a clear subject line, polite greeting, concise body paragraphs, and appropriate closing"

Perfect for improving prompts on AI chat platforms, email composition, social media posts, and more!
