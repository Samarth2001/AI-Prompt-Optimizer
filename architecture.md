# Prompt Enhancer Chrome Extension - Updated Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This updated PRD incorporates security enhancements, privacy safeguards, vulnerability mitigations, and compliance with Chrome extension development guidelines and Chrome Web Store program policies (based on the latest available information as of July 18, 2025). Key references include Google's Developer Program Policies, which emphasize safety, honesty, usefulness, user privacy protection, and no deceptive practices. Manifest V3 is fully adhered to, avoiding remote code execution and ensuring minimal permissions. No significant policy changes for 2025 beyond the ongoing Manifest V2 deprecation (which doesn't affect this V3 extension) were identified. The extension will include a clear privacy policy, transparent data handling, and justifications for all permissions in the manifest and store listing.

The focus remains on simplicity: A floating "Enhance" button that extracts, enhances, and replaces prompts using OpenRouter (default) or BYOK, with session context cached in memory only. All updates prioritize a "privacy-first" and "security-by-design" approach to avoid overengineering while eliminating vulnerabilities like XSS, injection, or data leaks.

## Executive Summary
- **Security and Privacy Enhancements**: API keys stored securely in chrome.storage.local (isolated per extension). All network requests use HTTPS. Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS. No data collection beyond what's needed for enhancement (prompts sent only to user-selected APIs). Session context is ephemeral (memory-only, cleared on reload).
- **Vulnerability Mitigations**: Input sanitization, minimal permissions, no innerHTML usage, HTTPS enforcement, error handling with retries but no exposure of sensitive data.
- **Compliance**: Aligns with Chrome Web Store policies: Transparent functionality, no spam, useful value. Permissions justified in manifest. Privacy policy included in store listing and options page. No objectionable content or risks.
- **Changes from Previous**: Added CSP in manifest, HTTPS checks, permission justifications, security tasks. No impact on timeline (still 8-10 weeks).
- **Success Metrics**: Unchanged, but add "Zero reported security incidents in first 3 months" and "100% compliance in Web Store review."

## Features and Workflow
Unchanged from previous, with these security/privacy additions:
- **Data Flow**: Prompt extraction and context caching occur in content scripts. API calls from service worker only. All data sanitized before sending (e.g., strip any potential scripts).
- **BYOK**: Keys validated client-side (e.g., length/format checks) before storage. Never sent to external servers except for the user's API provider.
- **Fallbacks**: If API fails, use local rules only—no external calls. Errors shown as neutral messages (e.g., "Enhancement failed—try again") without leaking details.
- **Session Context**: Cached in a JS array within content script (e.g., limited to 5 messages). No persistence; cleared via `window.onbeforeunload`. Users can disable via settings for extra privacy.

## Technical Requirements
### APIs and Integrations
- **Default LLM: OpenRouter**: Use HTTPS endpoint only. Include user-agent header identifying the extension for transparency.
- **BYOK**: Support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google via their HTTPS APIs. Keys stored encrypted if possible (Chrome storage is secure by default; add optional passphrase prompt for high-sensitivity users).
- **Chrome APIs**: 
  - Permissions: `storage` (for settings/keys), `scripting` (for injection), `activeTab` (for current tab access). Host permissions limited to supported sites (e.g., `*://chat.openai.com/*`, `*://claude.ai/*`, `*://gemini.google.com/*`).
  - Justification: `storage` for user prefs; `scripting` for button injection and DOM manipulation; `activeTab` for site detection; hosts for content script execution. No broad permissions like `*://*/*` or `webRequest`.

### Performance and Security
- **Performance**: Unchanged.
- **Security Implementation**:
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict policy in manifest to block XSS:
    ```
    {
      "content_security_policy": {
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
      }
    }
    ```
    For any WASM or sandbox needs (none here), extend safely. Avoid `document.write()` or `innerHTML`; use `createElement` and `textContent` for all DOM insertions.
  - **Network Security**: Enforce HTTPS for all API calls (e.g., via `fetch` with mode: 'cors'). No HTTP fallbacks. Validate API responses (e.g., check status codes, sanitize JSON).
  - **Input Sanitization**: Escape all extracted DOM text (prompt/context) using `DOMPurify` (include as a local library if needed, or vanilla JS escaping) before API send or replacement.
  - **Vulnerability Avoidance**:
    - XSS/Injection: Validate message senders in chrome.runtime.onMessage. No eval or dynamic code.
    - Data Leaks: No logging of prompts/keys. No external analytics without opt-in (and even then, anonymized).
    - Side-Channel Attacks: Perform sensitive ops (API calls) in service worker, not content scripts.
    - Rate Limiting: Client-side throttling to prevent abuse (e.g., 1 enhancement/5 seconds).
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation (e.g., fallback to rules on network errors). No exposure of keys in errors.
- **Privacy Measures**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Only access DOM elements needed (input field, chat history). No full page reads.
  - **User Control**: Settings toggle for context use, API selection. Clear disclosure: "Your prompts are sent to [provider] for enhancement. We don't store or share them."
  - **No Collection**: No telemetry unless opt-in (anonymous usage stats only, e.g., enhancement count). No sync of sensitive data (keys stay local).
  - **Privacy Policy**: Simple policy in options page and store listing: "This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data beyond what you explicitly send to your chosen AI API. API keys are stored locally on your device. Session context is memory-only and discarded on page close."
  - **GDPR/Compliance**: Local-first; no server-side processing. Users can delete stored data via settings.

### Risks and Mitigation
Updated with security focus:
- **Site UI Changes**: Mitigation unchanged.
- **API Costs/Quotas**: Unchanged.
- **Privacy/Security Breaches**: High risk. Mitigation: Third-party audit in testing phase; use Chrome's security guidelines; test for XSS/CSRF.
- **Web Store Rejection**: Medium. Mitigation: Early policy review; include permission justifications in store submission; beta test for compliance.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Low after mitigations. Mitigation: Code reviews, automated scans (e.g., ESLint security plugins).

## Architecture
Updated manifest snippet:
```
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Prompt Enhancer",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab", "scripting"],
  "host_permissions": ["*://chat.openai.com/*", "*://claude.ai/*", "*://gemini.google.com/*"],
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
  },
  // ... other fields
}
```
- **Components**: Unchanged, but add sanitization in enhancer.js and adapters.
- **Data Flow**: Add sanitization step before API send.
- **Extensibility**: Ensure new adapters follow same security rules (e.g., no broad selectors).

### Technologies
- **Add**: DOMPurify (local minified version) for sanitization if needed.
- **Linting**: Add ESLint-plugin-security for vulnerability detection.
