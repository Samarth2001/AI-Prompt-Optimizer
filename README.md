# Prompt Enhancer

A Chrome extension that enhances your prompts on major AI chat platforms.

## How It Works

The extension adds an "âœ¨ Enhance" button to text fields on supported sites. Click it to refine your prompt for better clarity and performance.

**Default Mode (Free)**: Your prompts are enhanced through our secure proxy service, offering up to 100 free enhancements per day. No API key is required.

**BYOK Mode (Bring Your Own Key)**: For advanced users, you can use your own OpenRouter API key for unlimited enhancements.

## Features

- **One-click prompt enhancement**

- **Two modes**: A generous free tier and an optional BYOK mode.

## Setup

1. **Install Extension**: Load the extension in Chrome.
2. **Start Enhancing**: The extension is ready to use in the default free mode.
3. **(Optional) BYOK Mode**: To use your own key, click the extension icon, switch to BYOK mode, and enter your OpenRouter API key.
